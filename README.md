# Mobile-Ad-Hoc
In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on a greater scale e.g. war, a disaster for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of the environment. 

As mobile devices with high-resolution touch screens have become more affordable, lightweight, and energy-efficient, they have become popular for both military and civilian purposes. Nevertheless, for communications, these devices rely on existing and stable infrastructure to function “right out of the box.”

A Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gateway device. The conceptualized MANET protocol shall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols.

Mobile devices supported by a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) make communication and coordination possible among mobile devices during emergency situations. We propose to develop a prototype of an Android-based application that works using MANET that will provide communication and information required for search and rescue operations for emergency scenarios.
